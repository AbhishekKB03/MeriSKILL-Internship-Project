# MeriSKILL-Internship-Project
Utilized Power BI to create a dynamic sales analysis dashboard that visualizes revenue indicators, top-selling goods, and sales patterns. The dashboard offered useful information to support strategic business growth and informed decision-making.

## Project Structure:
Data: Consists of the unprocessed data files needed for analysis.
- Scripts: Consists of any code or scripts utilized throughout the data transformation procedure.
- Visualizations: Holds exported visualization images and Power BI file storage.
Documents: Files containing documentation, such as this README.

## Insights:
In order to come up with this visualization, I used Power Query Editor in Power Bi to initially transform unorganized data before creating this visualization. Then, using the order data column, I generated the calculative column for then month name, month no, day name, and day no.

1) Created a "Month Name" column from the data column in order to view monthly analysis. 

2) Created a "Day Name" column from the data column to identify the days of the week products were purchased.

## Key Insights:
1)Sales Trend: The line chart shows that the highest sales were made in December. This can be because of the holiday and tradition of gift giving in December.

2) Top selling products: Using a bar chart, we can identify the top 5 selling products.

3) Using KPI's we can identify revenue and the revenue metric by calculating the sales quantity and profit margin. This indicates that this year's profit was high.

4) Also did some additional analysis to find out top 5 cities by sales using the map visual and top 5 products by sales using the tree map.
